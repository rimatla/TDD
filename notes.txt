- TDD is a style of coding where you not only CODE the features but also TEST those features beforehand (first).
- Your code is DRIVEN by your test
- Unit test is named as such because it looks for the the smallest part of your application as a unit and checks for proper behavior.

1- Write a single unit test to describe aspects or features of your app
2- Run the test and see if it fails (it should, since there's no feature yet)
3- Then, Write the feature for the test to pass.
4- Refactor the code to reduce duplication and so that it's composed to a minimum number of components, methods, lines, etc.
5- Repeat process 1 to 4.

Why TDD?
- Adopting this style largely reduces errors and bugs
- Leads to better code style
- Greater degree of technical quality.

ENZYME
Is a test library created by Airbnb, which allows to test React Component and
make assertions on how the components react to user behavior like typing into an input or clicking a button for instance.

yarn add react-test-renderer react-dom --save-dev

*************************
BDD
Behavior Driven Development is a variation of TDD that SPLITS the development of app features into user scenarios and behaviors that can affect the state of the app.
By using terms ie: given, when, then...
BDD helps capture that diff users might expect diff results given a certain state of the app
