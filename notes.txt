- TDD is a style of coding where you not only CODE the features but also TEST those features beforehand (first).
- Your code is DRIVEN by your test
- Unit test is named as such because it looks for the the smallest part of your application as a unit and checks for proper behavior.

1- Write a single unit test to describe aspects or features of your app
2- Run the test and see if it fails (it should, since there's no feature yet)
3- Then, Write the feature for the test to pass.
4- Refactor the code to reduce duplication and so that it's composed to a minimum number of components, methods, lines, etc.
5- Repeat process 1 to 4.

Why TDD?
- Adopting this style largely reduces errors and bugs
- Leads to better code style
- Greater degree of technical quality.
